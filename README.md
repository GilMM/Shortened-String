# Shortened-String

The function accepts as a parameter a string, and turns it into a shortened string.
Given a string of characters, the program searches for ascending sequences of characters from the English alphabet that are at least three characters in length. For each identified sequence, it shortens it to three characters: the first letter of the sequence, a dash, and the last letter of the sequence. For example, in the provided string 'dabcefLMNOpQrstuv567zyx', there are three ascending sequences highlighted as follows:
dabcefLMNOpQrstuv567zyx
These sequences will be transformed to:
da-cefL-OpQr-v567zyx
